          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income</h2>
          <p>The image above is a scatter plot showing the relationship between the percentage of poverty 
            and the percentage of obesity in states across the United States. Each "dot" in the scatter plot 
            has the state abbreviations so that each state is easily identified wihtout manipulating our markers
            or axis.
          </p>

          <p>Looking at the data points of the states the obvius trend that can be seen is that the data appears pretty linear.
            As the % poverty increases the % obesity increases. With the exception of a few outlying states Washington DC being one of the
            greatest outliers. There is no concrete evidence which came first the poverty or the obesity, but it is a reasonable assumption
            that with the low cost of unhealthy fast food compared to the monetary and temporal cost of healthy balanced meals that poverty
            could lead to obesity.   

          </p>

          <p>I was dissapointed that the capital of the richest country had one of the higher rates of poverty. I wish that we had average
            math and reading test scores as well so that we could run the comparrison between education and poverty as well. We could run a few statistical tests
            to see the correlation between poverty and obesity. Specifically a p-value test and an R^2 / chi sq test to see how good of a fit
            the data is to a liner line.
